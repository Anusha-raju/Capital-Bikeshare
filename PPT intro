Discovering the Ride: Exploring Capital Bikeshare Usage
Imagine you're exploring the vibrant streets of Washington, D.C., zipping past landmarks and bustling neighborhoods on a Capital Bikeshare bike. But have you ever wondered: Who uses these bikes? What drives their choices? How far and how long are they riding?
Our project dives into these questions, analyzing over 700,000 rides from Capital Bikeshare’s extensive dataset. With over 700 stations spanning D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, this system connects communities with two-wheel freedom—offering both electric and classic bikes for casual riders and registered members alike.
What We’re Asking:
Electric vs. Classic Bikes: Which type do riders prefer, and how far do they go?
Trip Duration: Do electric bike riders tend to take shorter or longer rides?
Who’s Riding? What are the differences between registered members and casual users?
Neighborhood Trends: Which areas see the highest trip activity?
What We’ll Predict:
Can we determine whether a rider is a registered member or casual rider based on trip characteristics?
How well can we predict ride duration from trip and user data?
What clues help us predict whether a rider will choose an electric or classic bike?
With insights like these, we’re working toward better understanding user behavior and improving bikeshare systems for everyone.
